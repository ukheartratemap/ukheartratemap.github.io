    <div class="What-content info">
        <p>Resting heart rate is a way of showing how fast your heart is beating when you are not doing any activity, by measuring the number of times your heart beats in one minute.</p>
        <p>Resting heart rate is measured in bpm (beats per minute), however most commonly the number of beats is counted for 30 seconds and then the reading doubled.</p>

      <h2>Why is resting heart rate clinically significant?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="Clinically-content info">
        <p>Resting heart rate can be used as an indicator of a person’s general health.</p>
        <p>It is known that a higher than average resting heart rate puts a person more at risk of developing future problems such as cardiovascular disease (Hsia et al., 2009).</p>
        <p>The link between resting heart rate and health requires further investigation to find a guideline of the healthy resting heart rate a person should be aiming for.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Collect info">
      <h2>Why is it important to collect data on population resting heart rate?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="Collect-content info">
        <p>Collecting a large amount of data allows us to build up a more accurate representation of the UK population. This means public health researchers will be able to target interventions to improve resting heart rate where they’re most needed (Nanchen, 2018), and also monitor the response to those interventions, as the data continues to be updated.</p>
        <p>For the data collected to be able to help inform decisions about patients’ treatment and population health, it needs to be analysed and presented clearly. The interactive map makes it possible to compare the resting heart rates of different demographics. We can identify any ‘hot-spots’ in the data where an area has particularly low or particularly high resting heart rates, and come up with possible explanations.</p>
        <p>(Lau, 2016) states how it is important that the data collected and analysed is available for use by researchers with a range of ideas and perspectives, in order to have the best chance possible of the data leading to significant healthcare discoveries.</p>
        <p class="linktorecord">To record your resting heart rate, read the instructions on the <a class="linktomeasure" href="./Measure.html">Measure</a> page, and fill in the <a class="linktomeasure" href="./Survey.html">survey</a>.</p>

    <div class="Improve info">
      <h2>Can I improve my resting heart rate?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="Improve-content info">
        <p>It has been shown that a high resting heart rate can be improved by simple lifestyle changes. In fact, it is thought that lifestyle changes are far more effective in reducing a high resting heart rate than pharmacological interventions, and the beneficial effect to the individual is more wide-reaching and long-lasting (Nanchen, 2018).</p>
        <p>Some every day changes that will improve resting heart rate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce alcohol intake</li>
            <li>Stop smoking</li>
            <li>Maintain a healthy balanced diet</li>
            <li>Enjoy regular exercise</li>
            <li>Reduce stress</li>
        </ul>
