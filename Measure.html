        <p>You can measure your resting heart rate if you have been resting for at least 5 minutes, and have not been doing any exercise in the past 2 hours.</p>
        <p>To measure your resting heart rate you need to first find your pulse. You can use either your radial pulse (in your wrist) or carotid pulse (in your neck).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="Radial info">
        <h2>To find your radial pulse:</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="Radial-content info">
      <ul>
        <li>Hold out one hand flat in front of you with the palm facing up</li>
        <li>Place the first finger and middle finger of your other hand on your outstretched wrist, just below the base of your thumb</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="Carotid info">
      <h2>To find your carotid pulse:</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="Carotid-content info">
      <ul>
        <li>Use your first finger and middle finger to press gently into the side of your neck, just below the jaw line and to the side of your trachea (windpipe)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="Carotid-d info">
      <img src="./Carotid-diagram.jpg" alt="Diagram showing where to feel carotid pulse"/>
    </div>
    <div class="How2 info">
      <p>If you can’t feel your pulse in either of these places, try pressing your fingers more firmly, or move your fingers around within the area to try and feel for the beat.</p>
      <p>Once you have found your pulse, use a watch to time yourself and count how many times you feel the pulse beat in one minute. You can either count the number of beats for a whole 60 seconds, or count the number of beats for 30 seconds and multiply the result by 2.</p>
      <p>Instead of feeling your pulse, you can also measure you resting heart rate using a device like a blood pressure monitor, pulse oximeter, or personal fitness tracker if you have any of these available.</p>
      <p>This will give you your resting heart rate in beats per minute (BPM). For most people, the result will be between 60bpm and 100bpm.</p>
      <p>If you get a result below 40bpm or above 120bpm a few times, or your pulse feels irregular, then please consult with your GP. But don’t panic, this result may be normal for you.</p>
